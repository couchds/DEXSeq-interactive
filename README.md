# DEXSuite
Interactive analysis (and later, visualization) of differential exon usage. Currently exists as Python script using Jinja to convert DEXSeqResults HTML generated by R into a DataTable object with a sort function. This way you can easily limit your results to a subset of interest.

## TO-DO
- Dockerize
- Expand features (d3 visualizations, include backend database linking GeneId to symbol)
